# ZEPHYR-Wallet
A simple wallet for Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains that grants one the ability to send simple transactions
and view your balance.

Doesn't send any personal data like IP address to anyone, except the chosen RPC provider, but even that can be mitigated by running the wallet through a proxy service or by using a VPN
